## Overview
Vcpkg helps you get C and C++ libraries on Windows. This tool and ecosystem are currently in a preview state; your involvement is vital to its success.

For short description of available commands, run `vcpkg help`.

## Quick Start
Prerequisites:
- Windows 10, 8.1, or 7
- Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
- Git
- *Optional: CMake 3.10.2*

Clone this repository, then run
```
C:\src\vcpkg> .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
Then, to hook up user-wide integration, run (note: requires admin on first use)
```
C:\src\vcpkg> .\vcpkg integrate install
```
Install any packages with
```
C:\src\vcpkg> .\vcpkg install sdl2 curl
```
Finally, create a New Project (or open an existing one) in Visual Studio 2017 or 2015. All installed libraries are immediately ready to be `#include`'d and used in your project.

For CMake projects, simply include our toolchain file. See our [using a package](docs/examples/using-sqlite.md) example for the specifics.

## Tab-Completion / Auto-Completion
`Vcpkg` supports auto-completion of commands, package names, options etc. To enable tab-completion in Powershell, use
```
.\vcpkg integrate powershell
```
and restart Powershell.


## Examples
See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for specific walkthroughs, including [using a package](docs/examples/using-sqlite.md) and [adding a new package](docs/examples/packaging-zlib.md).

Our docs are now also available online at ReadTheDocs: <https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/>!
